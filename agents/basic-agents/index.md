# Basic agents

A basic agent uses a predefined strategy with a simple execution flow that works for most common use cases. It accepts a string input (a question, request, or task description) and sends this input to the configured LLM. The LLM may decide to call provided tools. The agent will execute the tools and send the results back to the LLM. This repeats until the LLM does not request any more tool calls and returns a string response. The agent then outputs this response.

In [Graph-based agents](../graph-based-agents/), you can see how to re-create the predefined strategy graph used by basic agents.

Prerequisites

Ensure your environment and project meet the following requirements:

- JDK 17+
- Kotlin 2.2.0+
- Gradle 8.0+ or Maven 3.8+

Add the [Koog package](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/ai.koog/koog-agents/) as a dependency:

build.gradle.kts

```
dependencies {
    // Stable
    implementation("ai.koog:koog-agents:1.0.0")

    // Beta
    implementation("ai.koog:koog-agents-additions:1.0.0-beta")
}
```

build.gradle

```
dependencies {
    // Stable
    implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents:1.0.0'

    // Beta
    implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents-additions:1.0.0-beta'
}
```

pom.xml

```
<dependency>
    <!-- Stable -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>
        <artifactId>koog-agents-jvm</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Beta -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>
        <artifactId>koog-agents-additions-jvm</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-beta</version>
    </dependency>
</dependency>
```

Get an API key from an LLM provider or run a local LLM via Ollama. For more information, see [Quickstart](../../quickstart/).

Examples on this page assume that you have set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Create a minimal agent

To create the most basic agent, instantiate [`AIAgent`](https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-core/ai.koog.agents.core.agent/-a-i-agent/index.html) and provide a [prompt executor](../../prompts/prompt-executors/) with a [language model](../../model-capabilities/#creating-a-model-llmodel-configuration):

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")),
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o
)
```

This agent will expect a string as input and return a string as output. To run the agent, use the `run()` function with some user input:

```
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val result = agent.run("Hello! How can you help me?")
    println(result)
}
```

```
AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .build();
```

This agent expects a string as input and returns a string as output. To run the agent, use the `run()` method with some user input:

```
String result = agent.run("Hello! How can you help me?");
System.out.println(result);
```

The agent will return a generic answer, such as:

```
I can assist with a wide range of topics and tasks. Here are some examples:

1. **Answering questions**: I can provide information on various subjects, from science and history to entertainment and culture.
2. **Generating text**: I can help with writing tasks, such as suggesting alternative phrases, providing definitions, or even creating entire articles or stories.
3. **Translation**: I can translate text from one language to another, including popular languages such as Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.
4. **Conversation**: I can engage in natural-sounding conversations, using context and understanding to respond to questions and statements.
5. **Brainstorming**: I can help generate ideas for creative projects, such as writing stories, composing music, or coming up with business ideas.
6. **Learning**: I can help with language learning, explaining grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
7. **Calculations**: I can perform mathematical calculations, including basic arithmetic, algebra, and more advanced math concepts.

What's on your mind? Do you have a specific question, topic, or task you'd like to tackle?
```

## Add a system prompt

Provide a [system message](../../prompts/prompt-creation/#system-message) to define the agent's role as well as the purpose, context, and instructions related to the task.

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")),
    systemPrompt = "You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.",
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o
)
```

```
AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .systemPrompt("You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.")
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .build();
```

The instructions in the system prompt will guide the agent's response:

```
I'm here to help you navigate the wild world of internet memes!

What's on your mind? Are you trying to understand a specific meme, need help finding a popular joke, or perhaps want some recommendations for trending memes? Let me know, and I'll do my best to provide you with some LOLs!
```

## Configure LLM output

You can provide some [LLM parameters](../../llm-parameters/#llm-parameter-reference) directly to the agent constructor (Kotlin) or via the builder methods (Java) to customize the behavior of the LLM. For example, use the `temperature` parameter to adjust the randomness of the generated responses:

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")),
    systemPrompt = "You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.",
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,
    temperature = 0.7
)
```

```
AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .systemPrompt("You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.")
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .temperature(0.7)
    .build();
```

Here are some response examples with different temperature values:

```
I'm here to help you navigate the wild world of internet memes! Whether you're looking for explanations, examples, or just want to share a meme with someone, I'm your go-to expert. What's on your mind? Got a specific meme in mind that's got you curious? Or maybe you need some meme-related advice? Fire away!
```

```
I'm here to help you navigate the wild world of internet memes!

What's on your mind? Need help understanding a specific meme, finding a popular joke or trend, or maybe even creating your own meme? Let's get this meme party started!
```

```
I'd be happy to help you navigate the wild world of internet memes!

Whether you're looking for explanations of classic memes, suggestions for new ones to try out, or just want to discuss your favorite meme culture trends, I'm here to assist. What's on your mind?

Do you have a specific question about memes (e.g., "What does this meme mean?"), or are you looking for some meme-related recommendations (e.g., "Can you recommend a funny meme to share with friends?"). Let me know how I can help!
```

## Add tools

Agents can use [tools](../../tools/) to perform specific tasks.

First, create a tool by annotating a function (Kotlin) or method (Java) with the [`@Tool`](https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-tools/ai.koog.agents.core.tools.annotations/-tool/index.html) annotation:

```
@Tool
@LLMDescription("Ask the user a question by sending it to stdout and return the answer from stdin")
fun askUser(
    @LLMDescription("Question from the agent")
    question: String
): String {
    println(question)
    return readln()
}
```

Then, use the [`ToolRegistry`](https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-tools/ai.koog.agents.core.tools/-tool-registry/index.html) to make this tool available to the agent:

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")),
    systemPrompt = "You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.",
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,
    temperature = 0.7,
    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {
        tool(::askUser)
    }
)
```

In the example, `askUser` is a tool that helps the agent maintain a conversation with the user via printing and reading from the console. If the agent decides to ask the user a question, it can call this tool that writes to `stdout` via `println()` and reads from `stdin` via `readln()`.

```
// Create a ToolSet class
class UserConversationTools implements ToolSet {
    @Tool
    @LLMDescription("Ask the user a question by sending it to stdout and return the answer from stdin")
    public String askUser(
        @LLMDescription("Question from the agent")
        String question
    ) {
        System.out.println(question);
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
}
```

Then, use the [`ToolRegistry`](https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-tools/ai.koog.agents.core.tools/-tool-registry/index.html) to make this tool available to the agent:

```
UserConversationTools askUser = new UserConversationTools();

ToolRegistry toolRegistry = ToolRegistry.builder()
        .tools(askUser)
        .build();

AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .systemPrompt("You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.")
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .temperature(0.7)
    .toolRegistry(toolRegistry)
    .build();
```

In the example, `askUser` is a tool that helps the agent maintain a conversation with the user via printing and reading from the console.

Here is an example interaction with the agent:

```
Agent: Which meme would you like me to explain? Please choose from: Grumpy Cat, Success Kid, or Doge.

User: Explain Doge

Agent:

**Doge**

Doge is a popular internet meme that originated on the imageboard website 4chan in 2013. The meme features a picture of a Shiba Inu dog with a caption written in a playful, exaggerated style.

The typical format of a Doge meme includes:

* A photo of a Shiba Inu dog
* A caption written in all capital letters, using a intentionally simplistic and childlike tone
* Exaggerated or made-up words or phrases, often used to convey a humorous or nonsensical idea

Examples of Doge memes might include:

* "Such wow. Such happy."
* "I had fun today!"
* "Wow, I am good at napping."

The meme is known for its lighthearted and playful tone, and is often used to express excitement, happiness, or silliness. The meme has since become a cultural phenomenon, with countless variations and parodies emerging online.
```

## Adjust agent iterations

To avoid infinite loops, Koog allows any agent to take a limited number of steps (50 by default). Use the `maxIterations` parameter to either increase this limit if you expect the agent to require more steps (such as tool calls and LLM requests) or decrease it for agents that require only a few steps. For example, a simple agent described here is not likely to require more than 10 steps:

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")),
    systemPrompt = "You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.",
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,
    temperature = 0.7,
    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {
        tool(::askUser)
    },
    maxIterations = 10
)
```

```
// Create a ToolSet class
class UserConversationTools implements ToolSet {
    @Tool
    @LLMDescription("Ask the user a question by sending it to stdout and return the answer from stdin")
    public String askUser(
        @LLMDescription("Question from the agent")
        String question
    ) {
        System.out.println(question);
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
}

// In main method:
UserConversationTools askUser = new UserConversationTools();

ToolRegistry toolRegistry = ToolRegistry.builder()
        .tools(askUser)
        .build();

AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .systemPrompt("You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.")
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .temperature(0.7)
    .toolRegistry(toolRegistry)
    .maxIterations(10)
    .build();
```

Tip

Instead of passing the model, temperature, max iterations, and other parameters directly to the Kotlin constructor or Java builder, you can also define and pass them as a separate configuration object. For more information, see [Agent configuration](../#agent-configuration).

## Handle events during agent runtime

To assist with testing and debugging, as well as making hooks for chained agent interactions, Koog provides the [EventHandler](https://api.koog.ai/agents/agents-features/agents-features-event-handler/ai.koog.agents.features.eventHandler.feature/-event-handler/index.html) feature.

Call the `handleEvents()` function inside the agent constructor lambda to install the feature and register event handlers:

```
val agent = AIAgent(
    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")),
    systemPrompt = "You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.",
    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,
    temperature = 0.7,
    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {
        tool(::askUser)
    },
    maxIterations = 10
){
    handleEvents {
        // Handle tool calls
        onToolCallStarting { eventContext ->
            println("Tool called: ${eventContext.toolName} with args ${eventContext.toolArgs}")
        }
    }
}
```

Use the `.install()` method on the agent builder to register event handlers with `EventHandler.Feature`:

```
// Create a ToolSet class
class UserConversationTools implements ToolSet {
    @Tool
    @LLMDescription("Ask the user a question by sending it to stdout and return the answer from stdin")
    public String askUser(
        @LLMDescription("Question from the agent")
        String question
    ) {
        System.out.println(question);
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
}

// In main method:
UserConversationTools askUser = new UserConversationTools();

ToolRegistry toolRegistry = ToolRegistry.builder()
        .tools(askUser)
        .build();

AIAgent<String, String> agent = AIAgent.builder()
    .promptExecutor(simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")))
    .systemPrompt("You are an expert in internet memes. Be helpful, friendly, and answer user questions concisely, showing your knowledge of memes.")
    .llmModel(OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o)
    .temperature(0.7)
    .toolRegistry(toolRegistry)
    .maxIterations(10)
    .install(EventHandler.Feature, config -> {
        config.onToolCallStarting(eventContext -> {
            System.out.println("Tool called: " + eventContext.getToolName() +
                " with args " + eventContext.getToolArgs());
        });
    })
    .build();
```

The agent will now output something similar to the following when it calls the `askUser` tool:

```
Tool called: askUser with args {"question":"Which meme would you like me to explain?"}
```
